## Ruby Design Principles

- Interpreted language - it was conceived as being a scripting language
- Object-Oriented but supports multiple programming paradigms
- Dynamically Typed like JS
- Designed to be easy to read and human centric and fun!
- Everything is an object
- All functions are actually methods of an object, and methods declared at the global scope are just methods of a global object
- Synchronous (no callbacks/promises) but has a concurrency model

## Similarities and differences with JS

- SAME: Intrepreted, dynamically typed, scripting, same age
- DIFF: Ruby has concurrency, inheritance vs prototype
