## Ruby Design Principles

- Interpreted Language - it was originally conceived as a scripting language
- Ruby is Object-Oriented first, BUT it supports functional programming too
- Dynamically Typed
- Ruby designed to be fun and human-readable
- Everything in Ruby is an Object
- Synchronous code
  - No promises/callbacks
  - Concurrency Model instead

## Similarities and Differences with JS

- SAME: Interpreted, dynamic typing, scripting language, ruby and js are about the same age
- DIFF: Concurrency, Object-Oriented (inheritance vs JS's prototying)

## Basic and Syntax
