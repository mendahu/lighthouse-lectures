# Intro to Ruby

## To Do

- [ ] Why learn Ruby at LHL?
- [ ] Ruby Basics and Design Principles
- [ ] Similarities/Differences to JS and Node.JS
- [ ] Syntax
- [ ] Blocks, Lambdas
- [ ] Classes

# How to do deal with being thrust into a environment you don't understand?

- Docs are your friend!!!!1
- Seek breadth and not depth
- Have confidence!!!

## LSD

Logic / Syntax / Data

- Logic - programatiicaly, how you do solve something (loop? function? iterating, are you abstracting, object??)
- Syntax - what does that solution look like in code?
- Data - The guts of what you're manipulating

# Ruby Design Principles

- Interpreted language - same as JavaScript. Originally conceived as a scripting language
- Object-oriented FIRST, but supports multiple paradigms
- Dynamically typed, just like JavaScript (no type coercion in Ruby, however)
- Designed to be human-readable, human-centric, fun???
- Everything in Ruby is an object
- All functions are methods
- Synchronous (just like JS) - Concurrency Model solves

# Similarities and differences (with JS)

- SAME: Interpreted, dynamically typed, scripting language, same age
- DIFFERENT: Concurrency vs Promises, inheritance model vs a prototype

# Version managers and Basic

- In Node we have NVM
- In Ruby we have this as well, `rbenv` or `rvm`
- Ruby files end in `.rb`
- nomenclature - Ruby convention is `snake_case` not `camelCase`
