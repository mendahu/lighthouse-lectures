# What is React

- React is a Front End JavaScript Library for creating dynamic websites
- Underline Library, not a Framework
- In practice - most people build the entire application in React
- Fundamentally - React is using JavaScript to create and update HTML elements.
  - React-y stuff we've done - `createTweetElement(`<div>`)`
- React layers some new syntax in - specifically something called JSX
  - React Code and JSX do not run natively in the browser
  - We are introducing therefore a build phase to our application
  - Build phase is a layer between the developer's source code and the actual code that runs in the browser
  - Similar to SASS!

# Bootstrapping
