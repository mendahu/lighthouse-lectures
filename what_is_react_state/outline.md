# What is React State

- Today we're going to do a deeper dive in to react state to learn and internalize more on how it works and what some common practices are in using it to build things.
- The actual stuff we cover today won't actually be a lot of new things compared to the last time we talked, where we showed the `useState` hook, but the patterns will be new
- This will be an all-demo lecture - we'll get down to business and write React.

# Demo App

- We're going to build an inventory management app for fruit today
- This little app will allow you to keep track of fruit while you harvest them, and return some stats on how many fruit we have so far.
- The patterns we're going to learn today will help us reinforce state vs props, the rerendering process of React, lifting state up, and derivative state.
