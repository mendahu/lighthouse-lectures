# Final Project Brainstorming

- Today's goal is to have an experimental process to come up with application ideas.
- Especially early in your career, but also in general, generating ideas is an important part of the creative process!
  - As you build your portfolio you're going to be looking for different things to generate projects, and later in your career maybe you'll be pitching app ideas for real to investors!
- And of course, more imminently, you have a final project to come up with.
- So today we're going to be working together in a workshop style setting to generate ideas and pitch them to eachother.

# Pitches

- Let's talk about what a pitch is first
- A pitch is meant to be a short summary or description of an app designed to get someone's interest.
  - Key features of a pitch are they should be focused and short - think of the Elevator pitch, designed to be completed on a short elevator ride when you happen to bump in to someone you want to impress
  - Pitches should focus on the problem your app solves - a direct appeal to why it would be valuable for someone.
  - Pitches often skip over a lot of details or features that aren't directly related to this, even if they are important to the actual app
  - Pitches can use quick comparisons like "Tinder by for matching dogs with new owners" to quickly capture ideas that are already familiar to users
- In general it's nice to have a short phrase that describes your app, and then use that as your foot in the door to a conversation. Then you can move into a slightly more advanced explanation

# How to come up with ideas

- Remember that projects, software, codebases - these are all designed to solve problems.
- One of my favourite sayings is this: _Nobody wants a drill. What they want is a hole._
  - Nobody wants code. What they want is a problem to be solved, and code is a tool to help us solve it.
- So focus your idea generation on problems, rather than technology. It's often more useful to let the right technologies surface to solve the problem rather than the other way around
- An easy start is to think about things in your life that you wish were easier to do or automated entirely.
- Also think about your interests and your passions. The things in your life that you care about tend to also be the things you know the most about, and so your intimacy with problem opportunities there will be higher. Plus, you'll have more fun with your projet, and you may end up actually using it a lot more!

# Today's Exercise

- Ok, with that all in mind, let's get some work done
- I'm going to break you into breakout rooms with some random people.
  - In your breakout rooms, you're going to tell each other a few of your interests/hobbies.
  - Next, you'll compare all these hobbies and try to come up with an intersection of them
  - For example, if three people are intersted in dogs, cooking and art, maybe the intersection is decorative cakes for pets.
  - Once you have some idea on the intersection of those ideas, start formulating some concepts for an application that would be appealing to someone with those intersections of interests
  - Maybe the app is a recipe app for home made pet food!
  - Begin to formulate your pitch. Make sure you have a single sentence attention grabber, and a more thoughout 1-2 minute pitch.
- Once the breakouts are complete (15 mins), we'll go through and present everyone's idea. So make sure you have someone in the group designated to speak.
- We'll allow a short question period from the audience and myself, just to try and poke holes in the pitch and see if there are som eobvious things you missed
- After we're all done, I'll make a thread in Discord and we'll have each group post their pitch there in text form. Then we're going to do a voting system where everyone uses emojis to pick their top 3 pitches (using 1, 2 and 3 emojies)
- This can help highlight which pitches are good!

## Some notes about this exercise

- These results are non-binding - don't stress about this being your actual final project idea. What's important today is more the process of coming up with the pitch rather than the pitch itself.
- That being said if you do end up with a great idea and a great group of people, feel free to run with it!
- But I want to make sure you understand the stakes are low and it's ok to come up with some dumb ideas in order to let you go through the steps.
  - Feel free to pitch me Tinder for Fish or Tiktok but only for Videos of People Churning Butter or something
  - Real talk, too - bad ideas are sometimes really great for Demo Day. It's the implementation that's important, the way you put it together and make it useable and build functionality.
  - I've seen Demo Days about Facebook for Dogs, no kidding
