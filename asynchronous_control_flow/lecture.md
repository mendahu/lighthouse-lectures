## Asynchronous Programming vs Synchronous Programming

- JavaScript is a synchronous language
- Benefits:
  - Simplicity - easy to predict
  - uses fewer resources
- Problems:
  - Long running code - code that takes a long time to execute - is blocking

```js
const num1 = 2;
const num2 = 5;
const sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum);
```

RETURN AT 2:15PM EST / 11:15AM PST
