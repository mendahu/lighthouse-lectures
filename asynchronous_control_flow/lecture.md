### To Do

- [ ] Breakout! 20 minutes
- [ ] Asynchronous Programming
- [ ] Blocking vs Non-Blocking
- [ ] `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
- [ ] File System Functions (`fs`)

## Asynchronous Programming

- Key to the development of the web
  - probably applies to all development
- JavaScript, is a synchronous programming language - FULL STOP
- Simple

```js
const num1 = 2;
const num2 = 5;
const sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum);
```

- creates problem with something called blocking code

- Blocking code could be computationally heavy
- Network layer stuff -
- System level file reading

# Node

- What is Node????
  - Working environment to use JavaScript (~~without~~ like a Browser)
  - Backend for WebApps (Server software?)
  - Help you run code through terminal
  - It can interact with hardware on the computer - Read files, it can access the network card
  - Interface between JavaScript and the Server Computer itself
