# W02D01 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do

- [ ] Manual testing
- [ ] Making assertions
- [ ] Bringing in outside code
- [ ] Exporting our code
- [ ] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [ ] Mocha test runner
- [ ] Ignoring files/folders
- [ ] Chai assertion library
- [ ] What is TDD?
- [ ] Practice unit testing

## Test Driven Development

- **Before you write code**, you develop a testing strategy
- Red-Green-Refactor
  - You write a test, and it fails (RED)
  - You implement the function (GREEN)
  - You can refactor (GREEN STILL)
- Eliminates a common mistep which is writing a test with a bug

## Console.assert

- Part of the JS standard in a way
- `console.assert`

## Node Assert

- Part of Node built in
- assert.equal, strictEqual, deepStrictEqual
- throws errors!!

# Mocha

- Mocha is a testing framework
- Mocha is an indepdent open-source
- 3rd party package (we'll need to import it!)
- Describe and It syntax

# Chai

- It's another open-source project
- Assertion Library
- What is an assertion???
- you've been writing your own assertion libray
