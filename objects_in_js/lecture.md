# W01D03 - Objects in JS

### To Do

- [ ] Review primitive types
- [ ] Objects!
- [ ] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [ ] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [ ] Object iteration with `for..in`

# Data

# Primitives

- Simple data type - single value, single "thing"
- JavaScript has 7 types of Primitive data.
  - Boolean
  - String
  - Number
  - Null
  - Symbol
  - Undefined
  - BigInt
- Primitives are immutable - cannot be changed/altered/mutated

- Everything else is an object

  (Functions???)

# Objects

- Why do we have objects? What is the point of them???!
-

- Key/Property to describe data names
- Value for the data
- Key value pairs that are primitives work just the same

- All programming languages have some kind of "Object" (structure with key value pairs). Other names include Map, Dictionary, Hash

## Arrays and Object Iteration

- Seem similar - multiple values
- Serve different roles

- Arrays are useful for when you need to 1) iterate, 2) order is important, 3) if the length of the list is an important piece of data

- Objects are useful for when you want to 1) group related data , 2) when you want to access just specific parts, 3) lots of complexity/functionality
