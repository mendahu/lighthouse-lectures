      "So like they just go to space? Just like that? I was talkig with my cousin Mick and he says rockets aren't real. Now I don't know if he's telling the truth, since he does lie a lot. Like one time he told me there were a pile of gold coins in the woods and I spent hours looking for them while he was back at our lake house eating all the ice cream. Anyway I've been wondering about these rockets for a while because they seem sci-fi??? Please send me an email if you have any information about the veracity of these rockets.",

      "My friend Clare said this to me and what does it even mean? Planets go FORWARD that's it. You can't just change the direction that they travel, that would take so much energy, like millions of nukes worth. Clare is great and all (I'd take a bullet for her) but what does that even meeeean..... I'll post more about this later 'cause Clare and I are going skating and I'm going to get to the bottom of this. One way or another we'll find out what this retrograde nonsense is all about. Peace and love.",

      "Ok I know it sounds like a silly question but for real have you? Satellite are mystical creatures known only to faeries and wizards. I'm not convinced anyone has seen one, and if not, how could we put them in space? They're just FLOATING up there, no strings or anything and that seems unlikely. Apparently they are solar powered but then what do they do at night? My TV works just fine even at 3AM when I can't sleep and I figure one more re-watch of The Crown is the solution. RIP Elizabeth you're a class act. Please send me information abotu satelites.",
