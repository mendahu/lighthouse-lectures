# Intro

- Name, history, Job
- Quirky Fact - live in mexico - I'll post frog pictures in the chat here and there

# Tech Tips

- Some of these you can do along with me, so feel free to have a terminal and Discord open along side.

## Discord Handle

- How to change your Server name - full name
  - Don't change User Profile!
- City, pronouns
- Send a message so you're searchable

## Node Version

- Getting your Node version right is important
- Vagrant/WSL and M1/M2
  Vagrant 12.xx.x
  M1 15.14.0
- Check `node -v`
- What is NVM?
- `nvm ls` to show all node versions installed
- `nvm install 16` to add one
- `nvm use 16` to change
- `nvm alias default 16` to set default

## Security Settings for Screen Recording

- This is required for screen sharing, which you'll need for mentor calls
- Enable Chrome and Zoom

## Assistance Requests

- Two ways to initiate
  - Directly through Compass
  - Using Discord `/request-assistance`
- Will open a Discord forum post in your Assistance-Request channel
- Larry the AI Bot will try to help
- A Mentor will join
- Success Tips
  - Be descriptive in your request
    - don't copy paste errors - try to paraphrase them
      - ensures you read the message
      - helps the mentor know where you're at
    - tell us what you already tried

## Artificial Intelligence

- The dev space is awash with AI and everyone is learning how to incorporate AI in to their lives right now
- This space is experimental and volatile right now, so we think it's important to talk about how to use AI responsibly at LHL and in your dev career
- Artifical Intelligence is a Tool, and it should be deployed the same way you might deploy your macbook, your code editor, your testing tools, or whatever. It is best used when you are doing things you already know how to do but want to do them quicker and easier.
- The worst way to use AI is to have it write code for you that you don't understand and then deploy it anyway
- I like to draw an analogy to a carpenter and a chair.
  - Imagine you are a carpenter and need to build a chair.
  - So you draw up some designs, cut some wood, drill some holes, sand, finish, assemble and bam you have a chair
  - Along the way you'll use tools. It might be hand saw or a power saw, or a scrwedriver vs a power drill. Some tools might make you go faster or slower.
  - AI is like a hyper-tool. It isn't upgrading from a hand tool to a power tool. Instead, it's skipping the whole process and ordering the chair pre-assembled from Ikea.
  - The end result might be the same - you have a new chair now.
  - And if you're a carpenter already and you understand how chairs are made, you might be able to look at the Ikea chair and learn some things like "oh they used this kind of wood to keep the weight down" or "they used a slightly bigger screw here so they could have just one kind and keep things simpler. In these cases, sometimes getting the chair from Ikea is the right choice.
  - But if you weren't a carpenter, chances are you wouldn't learn anything from Ikea. You'd have a chair but you wouldn't have any new knowledge about how chairs are made.
  - AI for dev is like this. It can give you code you don't understand, and if you don't have the fundamentals to read it and understand it, you not only will fail to learn and get better, but you'll possibily introduce bugs into your code, too! AI isn't 100% right.
- With that in mind, remember why you're here - to learn to become developers! If you use AI to shortcut this, you're only hurting yourself and cheapening your experience.

- Here are some responsible ways to integrate AI in to your learning experience

  1. Use ChatGPT to explain a piece of code you don't understand. "How does this work?", "What are use cases for this?"
  2. Use ChatGPT to refactor your code, and explain why the refactoring is better
  3. Use ChatGPT to give you JavaScript problems to practice with

- Here are some irresposible ways to integrate AI in to your learning experience

  1. Fix this code
  2. Solve this JavaScript problem
  3. Give me the answer to this test question

- Finally, I want to stress that if you don't understand content that AI gives you, _do not use it_. Ask for more help, read docs, ask a mentor. Let AI move you to a place of understanding, but don't let it cover up your knowledge gaps.
