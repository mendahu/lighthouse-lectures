### To Do

- [ ] Recap: Components, Props, and State
- [ ] Immutable Update Patterns with Arrays and Objects
- [ ] Updating Complex State

## Immutability

- ???? What is it??
- Non-changing - not mutable - the non-mutable state of something
- Programming - not directly mutating/changing data
- Instead, you replace it with a new value
- Copying data, making changes, and replacing

## Benefits of Immutability

- Easier to build and use and test
- Operate in a pure function kind of way
- No side effects, testing consistency
- JavaScript specific benefit - objects in JS are passed by reference
