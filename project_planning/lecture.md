## Projects - what the heck are they

- loosely - defined as an undertaking which delivers at its close a product of value

* These two key parts - what is value, and what is its close, drive the concept of requirements
* "Definition of Done"
* Most projects will have some kidn of planning process to outline this all -
* In software, a portfolio site, maybe something bigger with a CMS, and larger applications like with databases, backends
* All of these are projects and can benefit from project management principles

## Types of Project Planning

- Unsolved problem - how best to manage a project
- In software, today, there are two leading consensus philosophies
- Waterfall, and Agile

## Waterfall

- waterfall is sort of the "classical" engineering management philsophy

PROS

- Intuitive - very structured
- Organized - easy to measure progress
- Documentation tends to be great
- Tend to waste less code
- One price!
- Less maintenance?? ****\*\*****

CONS

- Too rigid? Less flexible to changes
- Planning process is long (long == expensive)
- Low Utilization
- Roadblocks are common
- No client feedback til the end

# Agile

- took off in 2001
- Manifesto for Agile Software Development
- A focus on individuals and interactions rather than processes and tools
- Software that works prioritized over documentation
- Collaboration with customer instead of contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan

- Agile tends to revolve around continuous delivery
- lots of entry points for change

PROS

- Speed!
- Client satisfaction!
- Avoid building stuff they don't want
- High Utilization

CONS

- Messy? Lots of refactoring and throwing out code
- Never ends - definition of done?
- Hard to work as a team?
- Dependent on individual contributors
- Documentation suffers
- Lack of follow through can be harmful

## Scrum (implementation of agile)

- Scrum posits that small teamsn (10 or fewer) who self-organize works best
  - the team is cross-functional

* Products are broken down into the smallest valuable pieces possible.
* The group works in what's called a sprint, which is usually 1-4 weeks in length
* Along the way in a sprint, you will have daily scrum meetings (scrums, standups)
* at the end of a sprint, you will have two meetings.
  - Sprint Review - demo the product to the client
  - Sprint Retrospective - self evaluation

### Scrum Teams

- Product Owner - liaison between the business/client and the developer
  - they will own The Backlog™
- Developers - That's you! They make the stuff
- Scrum Master - A coach, run interference, remove blockers, keep the team performance high

### The Backlog™

- Product Owner translates business needs into user stories
  - Prioritizes them
  - maintains the list
  - beginning of a sprint, the devs pick off stories from the top of the list
  - Stories are sized (fibonacci)
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

## Project Planning, Tips and Tricks

- Time Management

  - It takes practice to guess times!
  - Measure your own work
  - Padding!

- Architecture

  - Be picky/stringent/skeptical of 3rd party tools
  - Don't use a dependency because you cant solve something
  - For your final - you only have 4 weeks. So every new library you have you learn is one less feature you get to write

- User Stories / Backlog Maintenance
- Database Design
- Routing
- Wireframes
